Deezer Scrobbler
================

A [GreaseMonkey][] script that scrobbles on [Last.fm][] the music beeing played on [Deezer][].

Note of warning: this currently does not work (Note to self: Invalid timestamp beeing sent perhaps?), except for the "Now Playing" part (says what is beeing played without scrobbling it).


Install
-------

Once you have installed [GreaseMonkey][] on Firefox, you may [install this script][install]. Then, visit Deezer and follow the instructions to allow the application to access your Last.fm account. It will then scrobble as long as GreaseMonkey is active.
