Deezer Scrobbler
================

A [GreaseMonkey][] script that scrobbles on [Last.fm][] the music beeing played on [Deezer][].

Requires
--------

- a Last.fm account
- a browser with GreaseMonkey (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox with the [GreaseMonkey][installff] extension, etc.)

Install
-------

- [install this script][install]
- visit Deezer and follow the instructions to allow the application to access your Last.fm account.

It will then scrobble all the time, as long as GreaseMonkey is active.

Code

- Author: [Sunny][]
- Source: [GitHub][]
- Licence: [WTFPL][]

It should be pretty trivial to adapt to any other website with the artist and track in the title of the page.
